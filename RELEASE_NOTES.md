# Emulation Layer — Release Notes

---

## Unreleased

### Build, Packaging & Developer Experience

- Updated Emulation Layer `--version` output to report the package version and include git revision and dependency revision information
- Enabled building and installing the native Emulation Layer with
  `pip install .` from the repository root.
- Enabled KosmicKrisp compatibility automatically based on selected driver.

### Tensor Shader Support

- Disabled advertising `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_TENSOR_SHADER_BIT_ARM` for BF16,
  E4M3, and E5M2 float formats because the tensor shader translator does not
  yet fully lower BF16 and float8 values and conversions. Tensor copy/transfer and
  data-graph support remains advertised.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed linear tensor/image aliasing to honor padded image row and depth pitches.
- Fixed optical-flow image/buffer alias alignment and tensor descriptor binding
  flag substitution.
- Split oversized Conv2D workloads across multiple dispatches when any workgroup
  count exceeds the corresponding physical-device limit.
- Fixed interval memory planning to preserve tensor live ranges across multiple
  graph dispatches.
- Fixed ambiguous shader conversion overloads for `uint32_t` convolution outputs.
- Prevented Resize interpolation from producing `Inf` or `NaN` for extreme
  floating-point inputs on affected devices by preserving operation order.
- Fixed optical-flow session independence, moving internal resource ownership to
  the session level, enabling safe parallel execution and per-session memory.

## Version 0.10.0 – *Optical Flow, Graph Profiling & Runtime Refinement*

### Optical Flow Task API

- Added support for `VK_ARM_data_graph_optical_flow`.
- Added optical-flow compute pipeline and shader execution support.
- Added optical-flow session memory and cache handling.
- Added runtime validation for optical-flow configuration and dispatch.

### Tensor & Graph API coverage

- Exposed `VK_ARM_data_graph_instruction_set_tosa` in the Emulation Layer.
- Added sparse external descriptor set/binding mapping support.
- Added specialization constant handling in graph lowering.
- Reused composite constant tensors during graph lowering.
- Updated descriptor set handling and runtime diagnostics.
- Added per-op graph-layer GPU timestamp profiling for compute pipeline
  dispatches, including serialized per-layer timing reports.

### Shader & SPIR-V™ Handling

- Improved SPIR-V™ code handling and graph/tensor-layer runtime paths.
- Added handling for floating-point constants in SPIR-V™ passes.

### Build, Packaging & Developer Experience

- Added an APK packaging script.
- Split binary and documentation build flows.
- Added detailed Emulation Layer implementation documentation and refreshed
  README coverage for ML extensions and instruction sets.
- Updated packaging and build tooling.

### Bug Fixes

- Refactored runtime paths to improve execution performance.
- Reduced memory usage in `MemoryPlanner`.
- Fixed graph lowering traversal to iterate backwards with the correct index.
- Fixed `conv3d`, `transpose_conv2d`, `int32 pad`, and signed-integer
  attribute handling.
- Fixed Darwin/MoltenVK-specific runtime behavior.
- Gated update-after-bind on uniform buffer feature support.

## Version 0.9.0 – *Datatype Support & API Coverage*

### New Datatypes

- Added BF16 and FP8 (`fp8e4m3`, `fp8e5m2`) support across SPIR-V™ passes and
  kernel execution paths.

### Tensor & Graph API coverage

- Added interception coverage for additional Vulkan® instance and physical-device
  query paths, including `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR`.
- Added support for `VK_EXT_tooling_info` and completed missing instance
  intercept-initialization paths.
- Updated graph/tensor behavior with higher-rank constant support and queue
  family property fixes.
- Added `VK_KHR_SYNCHRONIZATION_2` requirement in the graph layer.

### Build, Packaging & Developer Experience

- Added `use-float-as-double` build option for shader compatibility testing.
- Fixed Android™ shader source path handling
- Fixed Darwin usage documentation details.
- Fixed shader/runtime issues, including Reduce and Pad ops.
- Fixed `vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT` dispatch to use the device loader.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `vkCreateDevice` extension filtering.
- Fixed Pad/Reduce shader issues and tensor out-of-bounds reads.
- Fixed `vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT` to dispatch through the device loader.

## Version 0.8.0 – *API Coverage & Platform Expansion*

### New API

- Added Arm® Motion Engine Extended Instruction Set for SPIR-V™.

### Tensor & Graph API coverage

- Implemented `vkGetPhysicalDeviceExternalTensorPropertiesARM`, introduced new
  function skeletons, and exposed `vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties` plus
  `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR` so tooling can query the layers without
  falling back to core Vulkan® entry points.

### Build, Packaging & Developer Experience

- Modernized the pip package: switched to `pyproject.toml`, added the missing
  metadata, and fixed package naming/installation ordering issues that affected
  `--install`.
- Defaulted the build system to Ninja, refined the CMake packaging flow.
- Introduced `clang-tidy` configuration and streamlined cppcheck
  invocation/CLI integration (including build-script driven execution).

### Platform & Compliance

- Added Darwin targets for AArch64 to the pip packaging matrix.
- Refreshed SBOM data and adopted usage of `REUSE.toml`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed build-script packaging issues, including `setup.py` relative paths, bad
  package names, and SDK-root `--install` failures.
- Fixed `vkNegotiateLoaderLayerInterfaceVersion` handling in the Vulkan loader
  integration.
- Fixed `VkMemoryAllocateFlagsInfo` handling.

### Supported Platforms

The following platform combinations are supported:

- Linux - AArch64 and x86-64
- Windows® - x86-64
- Darwin - AArch64 via MoltenVK (experimental)
- Android™ - AArch64 (experimental)

## Version 0.7.0 – *Initial Public Release*

## Purpose

Provides a **layered Vulkan® implementation** of ML APIs for environments lacking
native ML extension support.

## Features

### Vulkan® Loader Integration

- **Dual-Layer Architecture**: Two separate layers - graph (`VK_ARM_data_graph`)
  and tensor (`VK_ARM_tensors`) — providing modular ML extensions for Vulkan® support. The
  graph layer depends on the tensor layer.
- **Vulkan® Loader Integration**: Seamlessly injected by the Vulkan® Loader
  without requiring application modifications

### ML Extensions

- **Universal Compatibility**: Enables ML workloads to run on any Vulkan®
  compute-capable device, regardless of native ML extensions for Vulkan® support
- **Fallback Implementation**: Acts as a bridge solution while native driver
  support for ML extensions matures across the ecosystem

### Shader compilation

- **SPIR-V™ Processing**: Advanced shader compilation and optimization through
  SPIRV-Tools, and SPIRV-Cross integration
- **Runtime Shader Compilation**: Supports both pre-compiled and runtime shader
  compilation modes for flexible deployment scenarios

## Platform Support

The following platform combinations are supported:

- Linux - X86-64
- Windows® - X86-64
